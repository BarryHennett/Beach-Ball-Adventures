Storyline

You are a Beach Ball living in your normal ball world and all of a sudden you get teleported to the front rooms. You must find your way to the end to escape the 5 deadly obstacles that are in your way. You are timed so watch out as the longer the time the older your family gets because one minute in the front rooms is 5 years real time.
